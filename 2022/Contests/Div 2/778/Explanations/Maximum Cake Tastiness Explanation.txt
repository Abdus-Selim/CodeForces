We can always perform an operation to make any two elements adjacent. It is always better to make the greatest 2 elements neighbours

The answer is the sum of the 2 largest elements. 

------

void solve()
{
    int no_of_elements;
    cin >> no_of_elements;

    vector <int> A(no_of_elements + 1);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
    {
        cin >> A[i];
    }

    sort(A.begin() + 1, A.end());
    reverse(A.begin() + 1, A.end());

    long long sum = A[1] + A[2];
    cout << sum << "\n";
}
