If any pile has > N/2 stones, that pile will remain standing even at the end. 

Otherwise, we are reducing the piles by 2 at each step. 
Let us take a stone from the two highest piles.
Since the largest pile has < N/2 stones in the beginning, it will always have < N/2 stones at every step. 
When the game ends, it cannot have 2 stones

In the end, there will be either 0 or 1 stones depending on the parity, which is invariant.
