We have to count the number of components in the complement graph. 
We also need a way to query if two vertices are connected. 


We will also maintain a set of all unvisited vertices. 
Pick up the first vertex in the unvisited set. 
Erase it 
Keep traversing the unvisited set till there is a vertex with which there is no edge and then repeat

-----

Why does this work ? 

It looks like it should time out since we are going through the whole unvisited set for each vertex. 

Let us count the number of times we will pick a vertex from the unvisited set. 
We perform two operations 
1. Pick up a vertex 
2. Skip it and go to next element in the set

There are N vertices in the set and each will be picked one time, after which it will be erased. 
How many times do we pick a vertex and skip it ? 
We will skip a vertex only if it has an edge with the current vertex. 
Since there are M edges, we can perform at most M skips.  

So the number of 'touches' we do to the unvisited set is O(N + M) 
We do N steps of Type 1 and at most M steps of Type 2

Each has a O(log N) factor 

Had to optimise the constant factor so used an adjacency vector instead of adjacency set.
