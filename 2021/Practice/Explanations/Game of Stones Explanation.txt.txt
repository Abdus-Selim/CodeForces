## Grundy Revision

- The grundy number of a state from which we cannot make a move is $0$.
    - The grundy number of a state is the $mex$ of the grundy numbers of the states it can transition to.
    - The reason is that it is similar to a pile with that many stones. We can either take some stones or add stones but not leave it as it is.
    - NIM does not change if we are allowed to add stones.

## Grundy Number of $(N, Mask)$

- Let $g(n, m)$ be the grundy number of a pile with $n$ stones and $m$ represents a bitmask where the $i$-th bit is set if we are allowed to take $i$ stones from the pile
- When we take $i$ stones from a pile, the size of the pile becomes $(n - i)$ and the mask also does not have the $i$-th bit set anymore.
- We can find out the $g(n, 111 ... 1)$ and find the answer by taking the XOR of all the piles.

## Why is this practical $?$

- The bitmasks can be as large as $2^{60}$ so how can we compute them $?$
- We will do it recursively and only evaluate those states which we need.
- Suppose we take a stone of size $25$ from $60$, not only does the size of the pile reduce to $35$, the eligible moves is also at most $35$, so all bits in $[36, 60]$ will be removed.
    - This is a great optimisation and allows us to find the grundy of the states quickly.
