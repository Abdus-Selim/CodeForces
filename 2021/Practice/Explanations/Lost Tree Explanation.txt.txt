Let us root the tree at 1. 
There will be some vertices at an odd distance from 1 and some at an even distance 

No 2 vertices of the same parity are connected. Otherwise, it would lead to a cycle. 

If we know the neighbours of any one parity (odd or even), we know the neighbours of the other parity too. 

One of these sets will have <= N/2 elements. 
We will choose the set with lower cardinality. 

-----

The reason this works is because trees are bipartite due to the absence of any cycle (of odd length, particularly). 

We are partitioning it into 2 sets and asking questions with the smaller set.
