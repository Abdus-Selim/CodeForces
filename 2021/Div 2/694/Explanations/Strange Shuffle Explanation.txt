# $A[p + i] + A[p - i] = 2k$ is invariant

- In the beginning, $A[p + 1] = k + k/2$ and $A[p - 1] = k/2 + 0$
    - $A[p + 1] + A[p - 1] = 2k$
    - After the first second, everybody other than $A[p - 1], A[p], A[p + 1]$ has $k$ cards exactly.
- Let us say this is true for the first $x$ seconds. In the $x + 1$ second, $A[p + x + 1]$
- Everybody to the right of the impostor has more than $k$ cards.
- Suppose there are $10000$ people.
    - Divide into chunks of $100$
        - $[1 - 100]$
        - $[101 - 200]$
        - $[201 - 300]$
    - After $101$ operations, there will be $100$ people with more than $k$ cards.
    - It should have at have spilled over to at least one other chunk.
    - I will spend $200$ moves ($2$ rounds) only checking the first person of each chunk.

    - Suppose the impostor is in chunk $73$ at position $64$
        - After $37$ moves, the infection spreads to chunk $74$
            - After $1$ move, the infection is in $65$
            - After $2$ moves, the infection is in $66$
            - After $36$ moves, the infection is in $100$
            - After $37$-th move, the infection goes to first person of chunk $74$
        - When you reach the chunk $74$, you will reach in the $74$th move. So, you are in time to catch the infection.
        - In this scenario, $100$ moves are sufficient.

- Suppose the impostor is in chunk $7$ at position $64$
- After $37$ moves, the infection spreads to chunk $8$
- But, you are visiting chunk $8$ at second $8$. So, you are too early to catch the infection.

Our strategy is 

- At $1$ second we go to chunk $1$
- At $2$ second, we go to chunk $2$

---

- Use $200$ moves to find out someone who has $> k$ cards
- Then use binary search to find the first person on his left who has $\le k$ cards.
