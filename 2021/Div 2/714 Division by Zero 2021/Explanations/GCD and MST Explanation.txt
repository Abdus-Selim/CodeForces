Let us visit the vertices in ascending order and check how many edges has this as the weight. 

If A[i] >= P, then we will stop because we no longer need to check anything and can just add the P-edges

Now, which vertices will have A[i] as the weight ? 

Check the nearest j to the i as long as A[i, j] or A[j, i] are >= A[i] and divisible by A[i] 

We will add another condition. 

Maintain a vector is_connected, which is true if A[i] is connected to the vertex A[i + 1], 
either directly or indirectly. 

When we are going left, we will stop at the first vertex j where is_connected[i] is true 
Since A[i] has been connected to A[j - 1] already, placing another edge between A[i], A[j] will create a cycle. 
Moreover, we are visiting the weights in ascending order so A[j] has been connected to A[j - 1] with less expensive edges.

When we are going right, we will stop at the first vertex j where is_connected[j - 1] is true because this means that 
A[j], A[j - 1] are already connected and A[j] was connected to the tree using lighter edges
