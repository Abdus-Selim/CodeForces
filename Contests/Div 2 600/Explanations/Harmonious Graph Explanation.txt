1. Let us look at each Connected Component seperately. 

2. For each connected component, let us look at the minimum L and the maximum R. 

3. Now, we have x segments - [L, R]. 

4. We will sort these segments by their Left Borders and keep track of the right most point we have met so far. If L_i < R, then it means we need to make another connection. 

5. We have to update R = max(R, R_i) at every step. 

If R is the rightmost point we have had so far and L_i < R, then it means L_i should be reachable from wherever we were able to reach R. 

This is the reason we will make 1 connection per component where L_i < R. Now the entire component [L_i, R_i] is reachable to the current segment.
