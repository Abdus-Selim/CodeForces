Here is the strategy -

If we eat the first i sweets, we want to minimise the penalty against each sweet.

So, we will eat the sweets with the highest penalty first -

We will eat the sweets in descending order.

Now, suppose f(i) is the penalty of eating the first i sweets.

We will eat sweets [i, i - k] on day 1.

All sweets [1, i - k - 1] will get pushed back by 1 day.
This means that the penalty against sweet j becomes (d + 1)*p(j) from d*p(j).

The total penalty increases by sum [i - k].

So, f(i) = (Sum[i] - Sum[i - k]) + f(i - k) + Sum[i - k]

We need to handle the base case of i <= k i.e. - When there is only one day seperately.
