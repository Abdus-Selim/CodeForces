There are many ways to solve it but the simplest will use the observation
that if n is not composite then some multiple of n will be composite.

n = (X + 1).n - X.n

We just need two values where we are sure X.n is composite.

X = 8 does that.

n = 9n - 8n

------

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    cout << 9*n << " " << 8*n << "\n";
    return 0;
}
