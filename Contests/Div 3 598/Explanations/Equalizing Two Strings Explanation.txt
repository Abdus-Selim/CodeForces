Consider any segment T of a string S. 

There are 3 types of inversions


1. Both characters in S
2. One in S and one in T
3. Both characters in T


only type 2 is affected by reversing a segment. 


If the length of the segment is L and there re x inversions, the number of inversions becomes L(L &mdash; 1)/2 &mdash; x



If the first term is even, the parity remains the same. 


Otherwise, the parity flips.
