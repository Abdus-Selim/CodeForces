Essentially an integer n is coloured white if it is possible to write n = Xa + Yb, where x and Y are any positive integers. 

If gcd(a, b) = 1, then there is always a positive integer L, such that it is possible to reach all integers >= L by a linear combination of a and b. 

If (a, b) are coprime, then the number of integers not coloured white is finite. 

Otherwise, it is infinite.

void solve()
{
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    cout << (__gcd(a, b) == 1 ? "Finite\n" : "Infinite\n");
}
