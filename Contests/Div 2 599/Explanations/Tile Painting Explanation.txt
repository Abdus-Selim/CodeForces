Bezout's Identity tells us that there are always two integers (A, B) such that 

Ax + By = gcd(x, y)

We can reach any multiple of G as well. 

To reach, KG, we need to multiply A and B by K.

In general, if we are given a set S of integers - {A_1, A_2, ... , A_k}

Then, we can reach any multiple of gcd(S)

Whatever colour we choose for x, we have to choose the same colour for (x + G) too
