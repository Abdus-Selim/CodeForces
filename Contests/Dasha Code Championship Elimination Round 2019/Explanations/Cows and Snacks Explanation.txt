1. Since each cow likes only 2 snacks, we can treat the cows as edges and the snacks as vertices. 

2. Let us look at 1 connected component of this graph. 2 snacks can be had by the first edge. After that, each snack can only be eaten by 1 edge. 

3. A connected component of size C will have at most (C - 1) happy cows. 

4. We will take the sum of all the connected components and then the number of unhappy cows = Total Cows - Happy Cows 

5. The reason we cannot simply write the answer as Total Cows - Number of Connected Components, assuming each component produces exactly 1 unhappy cow is that multi-edges are allowed in this graph. 

Only (C - 1) edges are enough to span the entire connected component but it can have many more edges and the cows correspond to edges.
