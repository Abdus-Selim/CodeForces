We want the ladder to be as big as possible. SO we will use the largest pieces of wood available to us to make the ladder's bases. 

Then we will be using A[n] and A[n - 1] to make the base. 

Now, we will try to use as many of the (n - 2) available planks available to us to make the ladder. But we cannot use more than (A[n - 1] - 1) planks. 

The height of the ladder is min{A[n - 1] - 1, n - 2}
