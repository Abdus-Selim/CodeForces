To check if it is possible to write n in i bits,

(n - ip) must have exactly i bits set in it's binary representation.

-----

(n - ip) will not be more than a 32 bit number in the given range so we only need to check from 1 to 32.

If it is possible for any value of i, it is the minimum.

If it is not possible for any i in [0, 32], it's not possible.

-----

int main()
{
    long long n, p;
    cin >> n >> p;

    int answer = 100;
    for(int i = 0; i < 32; i++)
    {
        if(__builtin_popcount(n - i*p) > i || (n - i*p) < i)
        {
            continue;
        }

        answer = i;

        break;
    }

    cout << (answer == 100 ? -1 : answer);
    return 0;
}
