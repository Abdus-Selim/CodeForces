We only need to keep track of the leftmost occurence of each element. 

We will maintain two pointers - L and R to keep a sliding window. 

When we increment R, we will check if the leftmost occurence of A[R] is < L, This would mean that A[R] is a distinct element in the current segment [L, R]. Otherwise, it would not. 

Although there are 2 for loops, the time complexity is O(n) since each of the N elements is visited at most twice by each of the pointers. 

We will find out the minimum number of distinct elements of all segments of length K.
