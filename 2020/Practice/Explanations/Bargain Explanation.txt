Whenever we are asked to compute a sum,
we must try to break it down and count the individual contribution of each term.

In this case, every cost consists of some prefix of the string concatenated
with some suffix of the string.

Let us count the contribution of each digit when it is

1. Part of the prefix
2. Part of the suffix.

-----

If a digit is part of the suffix, then it means there is no digit to it's right
that is deleted.

So, if it is the s-th digit from the right, it's value will be

10^s S[s]

How many strings have this digit in it's suffix ?

We can remove p(p - 1)/2 + p strings from the prefix,
where p = length of string before S[s]

So, the total suffix cost of S[s] = p(p + 1)/2 10^s S[s]

-----

Now, let us count the prefix cost of S[i].
This means that no character to it's left is deleted.

This is a little more tricky.

Suppose S[i] is the 5th character from the right.
