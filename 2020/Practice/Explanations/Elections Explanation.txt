Let us try to iterate over the final number of votes of the winning part.
If the winning party has T votes in the end, then

1. Every party with more than T votes has to have less than T votes
2. Party 1 must have at least T votes

-----

First, we will go through all the parties.
For each party, which has more than T votes, we will choose it's cheapest votes till it has less than T votes
Then, we will take the remaining votes, and start choosing the lowest cost till we have >= T votes
