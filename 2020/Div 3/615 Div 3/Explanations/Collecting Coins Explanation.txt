The total number of coins is (a + b + c + n).

At the end, every group must have T/3 coins.

We must ensure that T is divisible by 3 and then that each group has less than T/3 coins.

void solve()
{
    int a, b, c, n;
    cin >> a >> b >> c >> n;

    int total = (a + b + c) + n;
    cout << (total%3 == 0 && a <= total/3 && b <= total/3 && c <= total/3 ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
}
