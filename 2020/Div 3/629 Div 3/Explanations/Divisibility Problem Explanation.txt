We will always try to make a = the next multiple of b

We just have to add enough to make a = 0 (mod b)

If a = 0 (mod b) already, then we do not need to add anything

-----

void solve()
{
    int a, b;
    cin >> a >> b;

    a %= b;

    int answer = (a == 0 ? 0 : b - a);
    cout << answer << "\n";
}
