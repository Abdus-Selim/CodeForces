We will place blocks of length A

The block with have (b - 1) distinct letters followed by (a - b) occurences of b

For example here is a block with 5 distinct characters of length 9

abcdeeeee

We will simply place blocks like this next to each other.

When we slide the window, if the right pointer adds a new distinct character,
the left pointer removes a new distinct character.

This ensures every window of length A has B distinct characters

void solve()
{
    int length, substring, distinct;
    cin >> length >> substring >> distinct;

    string S;
    for(int i = 0; i < length; i++)
    {
        if(i < substring)
        {
            if(i < distinct)
            {
                S += (char)('a' + i);
            }
            else
