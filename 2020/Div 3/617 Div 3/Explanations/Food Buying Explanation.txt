We can just be greedy and simulate the problem.

We will use 10(X/10) coins. We will get (X/10) extra coins

We will repeat the same with the (X/10) coins that we have now and keep doing this until we have at least 10 coins

void solve()
{
    int budget;
    cin >> budget;

    long long no_of_moves = 0;
    while(budget >= 10)
    {
        long long move = budget/10;

        budget = budget - 10*move + move;

        no_of_moves += 10*move;
    }

    no_of_moves += budget;
    cout << no_of_moves << "\n";
}
