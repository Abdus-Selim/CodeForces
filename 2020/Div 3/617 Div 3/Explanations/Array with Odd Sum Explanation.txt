If there are an odd number of odd numbers, then the sum is odd

If there are an even number of odd numbers and there is at least one even number,
we can make the even number odd and get an odd sum

If there are no odd numbers, the sum will always be even

void solve()
{
    int no_of_elements;
    cin >> no_of_elements;

    int odd_count = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
    {
        int x;
        cin >> x;

        odd_count += (x%2 == 1);
    }

    cout << ((odd_count%2 == 1) || (odd_count > 0 && odd_count%2 == 0 && odd_count != no_of_elements) ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
}
