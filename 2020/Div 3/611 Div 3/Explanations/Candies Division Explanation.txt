After giving everyone C/N number of candies,
we will look at the remainder.

We can only give (C/2) or (C mod N) candies - whichever is lesser.

void solve()
{
    int no_of_candies, no_of_kids;
    cin >> no_of_candies >> no_of_kids;

    int candies_given_to_one_kid = no_of_candies/no_of_kids;

    int candies_given = no_of_kids*candies_given_to_one_kid;
    no_of_candies %= no_of_kids;

    candies_given += min(no_of_candies, no_of_kids/2);

    cout << candies_given << "\n";
}
