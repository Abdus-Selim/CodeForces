The inscribed polygon must also be a regular polygon so that means
it's vertices must be equally spaced

This means that m must evenly divide n

void solve()
{
    int original_vertices, new_vertices;
    cin >> original_vertices >> new_vertices;

    cout << (original_vertices%new_vertices == 0 ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
}
