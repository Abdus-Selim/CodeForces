Let us assume there are (a1, a2, a3) stones.
And a1 < a2 < a3

If a3 > a1 + a2 + 1, there have to be 2 consecutive flowers of a3.

Otherwise, we will first place the a3 flowers.

Then, we will put the flowers of type a1 in between the flowers from one end
and flowers of type a2 in another end.

void solve()
{
    long long red, green, blue;
    cin >> red >> green >> blue;

    long long total = red + green + blue;
    long long maximum = max_3(red, green, blue);
    long long remaining_sum = total - maximum;

    cout << (maximum <= remaining_sum + 1 ? "Yes\n" : "No\n");
}
