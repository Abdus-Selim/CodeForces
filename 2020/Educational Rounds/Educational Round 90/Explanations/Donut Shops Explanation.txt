If the cost of 1 donut is less than the cost of a box, then the answer is 1
Otherwise, it is impossible to buy donuts to be cheaper.

As for the second shop, we will try to buy a box. If it is cheaper, then that is the answer.
Otherwise, it is not possible

-----

void solve()
{
    long long cost, box_size, box_cost;
    cin >> cost >> box_size >> box_cost;

    int answer_1 = (cost < box_cost ? 1 : -1);
    int answer_2 = (cost*box_size > box_cost ? box_size : -1);

    cout << answer_1 << " " << answer_2 << "\n";
}
