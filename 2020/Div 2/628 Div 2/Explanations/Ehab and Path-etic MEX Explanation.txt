The crucial insight here is that there will always be a path running through
any 2 edges.

So, there will always be a path that runs through both 0 and 1 and will have MEX = 2

Now, is there a way, we can avoid having 2 on the same path as (0, 1) ?
The only way to do this is if some vertex had degree >= 3 and we label it 0, 1, 2

The mex of every path not containing 0 or 1 will be 0 or 1
The mex of every path containing both 0 and 1 will be 2

------

My strategy was to start with the leaves and maintain a queue of them.
After labelling an edge (u, v), we delete the edge and add u to our queue if u is now a leaf

If the tree has at least 3 leaves,
then it ensures that there is no path passing through (0, 1, 2)
since there can be no path that hits 3 leaves.

If the tree has only 2 leaves, then it is a bamboo and any labelling we do won't matter
