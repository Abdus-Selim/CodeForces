We concatenate the array N times with itself

We can pick all the distinct elements of the array and that will be the longest increasing subsequence

The length of the Longest increasing subsequence cannot be more than the number of distinct elements

As there is no element greater than the maximum element

void solve()
{
    int no_of_elements;
    cin >> no_of_elements;

    vector <int> A(no_of_elements + 1);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
    {
        cin >> A[i];
    }

    set <int> distinct;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
    {
        distinct.insert(A[i]);
    }

    cout << distinct.size() << "\n";
}
