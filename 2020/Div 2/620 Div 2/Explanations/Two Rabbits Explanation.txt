There are two rabbits.
The distance between them reduces by (a + b)
in 1 second.
The total distance to be covered is (x - y).

The rabbits will meet if (x - y) is a multiple of (a + b).
Otherwise, they will never complement

void solve()
{
    long long position_1, position_2, distance_1, distance_2;
    cin >> position_1 >> position_2 >> distance_1 >> distance_2;

    long long time = ((position_2 - position_1)%(distance_1 + distance_2) == 0 ? (position_2 - position_1)/(distance_1 + distance_2) : -1);
    cout << time << "\n";
}
