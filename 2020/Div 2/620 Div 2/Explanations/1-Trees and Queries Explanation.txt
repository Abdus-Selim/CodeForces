There is a crucial insight that we can make here.
We can make a 'waiting' move.

After we travel from a -> b, we can keep going back and forth on the same edge.
b-> c -> b

We can keep going back and forth to one of the neighbours of b.
This way, we can make an unlimited number of moves !

----

Suppose we have a path of length L.
There is a path of length (L + 2X) for every integer X.

----

Now, there are 3 Simple Paths from (a, b)

1. a -> b
2. a -> x -> y -> b
3. a -> y -> x -> b

----

If any of these path lengths <= k and have the same parity as k,
then we can use the required number of waiting moves to go from (a, b) and
use exactly k moves.

----

We can use LCA to calculate the distance between 2 vertices.
We can do O(N Log N) precompute and answer each query in O(Log N) time.

int main()
{
    int no_of_vertices;
    cin >> no_of_vertices;

    int no_of_edges = no_of_vertices - 1;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_edges; i++)
    {
        int u, v;
        cin >> u >> v;

        tree[u].push_back(v);
        tree[v].push_back(u);
    }

    depth[0] = 0;

    dfs(1, 0);

    precompute_parents(no_of_vertices);

    int no_of_queries;
    cin >> no_of_queries;

    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_queries; i++)
    {
        int x, y, a, b, k;
        cin >> x >> y >> a >> b >> k;

        int path_1 = distance(a, b);
        int path_2 = distance(a, x) + distance(b, y) + 1;
        int path_3 = distance(a, y) + distance(b, x) + 1;

        if( (path_1 <= k && path_1%2 == k%2) ||
            (path_2 <= k && path_2%2 == k%2) ||
            (path_3 <= k && path_3%2 == k%2) )
        {
            cout << "YES\n";
        }
        else
        {
            cout << "NO\n";
        }
    }

    return 0;
