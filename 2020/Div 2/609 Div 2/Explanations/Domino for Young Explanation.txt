We can think of it as a chessboard.Each domino covers one square of each colour.

The answer is whichever is minimum - black or white squares.

#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    int no_of_columns;
    cin >> no_of_columns;

    long long black = 0, white = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_columns; i++)
    {
        int no_of_rows;
        cin >> no_of_rows;

        black += (no_of_rows/2) + (no_of_rows%2 == 1 && i%2 == 0);
        white += (no_of_rows/2) + (no_of_rows%2 == 1 && i%2 == 1);
    }

    long long dominos = min(black, white);
    cout << dominos << "\n";

    return 0;
}
