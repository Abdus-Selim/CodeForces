The net reduction is H/2 or 10

As long as H/2 > 10, it is always better to do the first operation

And then, we can do the second operation to the maximum extent

We will check if the value is still > 0 after these operations

And give the answer accordingly

-----

void solve()
{
    int total, type_1, type_2;
    cin >> total >> type_1 >> type_2;

    while(total/2 + total%2 > 10 && type_1 > 0)
    {
        total = total/2 + 10;
        type_1--;
    }

    total -= 10*type_2;

    cout << (total <= 0 ? "YES\n" : "NO\n");
}
