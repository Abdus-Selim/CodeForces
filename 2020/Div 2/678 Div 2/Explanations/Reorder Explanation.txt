A[i]/i is counted i times, so we are actually counting

i(A[i]/i) = A[i]

The question is asking if the sum of the array is equal to m !

It's quite beautiful

-----

void solve()
{
    int no_of_elements, target_sum;
    cin >> no_of_elements >> target_sum;

    int sum = 0;
    vector <int> A(no_of_elements + 1);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
    {
        cin >> A[i];

        sum += A[i];
    }

    cout << (sum == target_sum ? "YES" : "NO") << "\n";
}
