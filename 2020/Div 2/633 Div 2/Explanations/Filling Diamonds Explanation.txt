It is difficult to explain this without drawing a diagram. 

The main idea is that if we place a diamond vertically, the rest of the positions are forced. 

In a diagram of (4n - 2) triangles, there are n positions where we can place a vertical diamond

The arrangement before and after the vertical triangle are fixed

So, the answer is always n

-----

void solve()
{
    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    
    cout << n << "\n";
}
