1. Suppose there are (k - 1) people in front of you. 
Ultimately, we will have p elements taken from the prefix and s elements taken from the suffix where (p + x = k - 1)

2. Suppose we can control C people. 
Out of these C people, we will make some of them take the prefix and some of them take the suffix. 
Out of the U people we can't control, u people will take the prefix and (U - u) will take the suffix.

3. Let us say we make c people out of C take the prefix. 
The U people we can't control will make their choice so as to minimise our sum. 

4. We will iterate over all possibilities. We will first fix that we will choose c people to take the prefix and (C - c) to take the suffix. 
The U people we can't control will make their choice in such a way as to minimise our sum. 

5. We will choose the value of (c, u) that gives us our maximum sum.
