We need to deal with 3 different cases.

1. Refill < usage
2. Refill = usage
3. Refill > usage

------

When refill < usage, we will refill it everyday to ensure it stays in the limit.
We only need to see if we can refill it on the very first day as a special case.

-----

When refill = usage, just check if refilling or using it makes it go out of bounds.

-----

When refill > usage, we do not want to overflow.
So, we will only refill it greedily just when another usage would make the
water level drop below L.

In fact, we will look at the water level (mod u).
As long as we are using without refilling, the remainder is invariant.
When we refill it, it becomes (x + R) (mod u).
We will check if we every visit a remainder that is already visited.
If so, we have reached a cycle and will be within [L, R] indefinitely.
