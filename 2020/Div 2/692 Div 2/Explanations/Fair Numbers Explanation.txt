In Any interval [L, L + X], there will be at least one multiple of x. 

The LCM of (1, 2, ... , 9) is 2520. 

In any interval of 2520 integers, there is at least one number that is divisible 
by all 9 digits. 

So the gap in between two fair integers cannot exceed 2520. 

This allows us to compute it using brute force.

int fair(long long n)
{
    long long value = n;
    
    while(n)
    {
        int digit = n%10;
        
        if(digit != 0 && value%digit != 0)
        {//cout << value << " not divisible "
            return false;
        }
        
        n /= 10;
    }
    
    return true;
}
 
void solve()
{
    long long n;
    cin >> n;
    
    long long answer;
    
    for(answer = n; !fair(answer); answer++);
    
    cout << answer << "\n";
