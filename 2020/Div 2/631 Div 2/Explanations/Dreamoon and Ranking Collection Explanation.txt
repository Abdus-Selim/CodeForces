The question is basically this

Add x elements to the array and give the greatest integer v such that
all integers from [1, v] are there in this array of length (n + x)

We will maintain a boolean array of which elements are already there in the array.
We will go from 1 to as large an integer as we can and fill up the first x 'empty' spots.

void solve()
{
    int no_of_elements, x;
    cin >> no_of_elements >> x;

    const int MAX = 1e5;
    vector <int> used(MAX, false);
    vector <int> A(no_of_elements + 1);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
    {
        cin >> A[i];

        used[A[i]] = true;
    }

    int answer = 0;
    for(int i = 1; i < MAX; i++)
    {
        if(!used[i])
        {
            if(x == 0)
            {
                answer = i - 1;
                break;
            }
            else
            {
                x--;
                used[i] = true;
            }
        }
    }

    cout << answer << "\n";
}
