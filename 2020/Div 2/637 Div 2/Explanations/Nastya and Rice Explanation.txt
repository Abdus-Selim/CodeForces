The minimum weight we can make n(a - b) and the maximum weight we can make n(a + b)

We must check if the maximum weight is not < minimum capacity and that the
minimum weight is not < maximum capacity

void solve()
{
    int no_of_grains, a, b, c, d;
    cin >> no_of_grains >> a >> b >> c >> d;

    int minimum_weight = no_of_grains*(a - b);
    int maximum_weight = no_of_grains*(a + b);

    int minimum_capacity = (c - d);
    int maximum_capacity = (c + d);

    cout << (minimum_weight > maximum_capacity || maximum_weight < minimum_capacity ? "No\n" : "Yes\n");
}
