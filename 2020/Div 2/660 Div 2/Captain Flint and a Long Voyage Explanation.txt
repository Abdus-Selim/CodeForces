First of all, we want the length of the binary number to be maximum possible.
So, we will use a 4 digit number.

If the digit is deleted, then we cannot distinguish between 8 and 9.
As they have asked for the smallest such answer if there are multiple, we will print 8

After all the deletions are over, we will print all 9's to make the integer as large as possible

 void solve()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    int eights = n/4 + (n%4 != 0);

    int nines = n - eights;

    for(int i = 1; i <= nines; i++)
    {
        cout << "9";
    }

    for(int i = 1; i <= eights; i++)
    {
        cout << "8";
    }

    cout << "\n";
}
