Let us think of the divisibility rules of each number.

A number is divisible by 5 only if the last digit if 5 or 0

So, we can make every digit except the last = 5

What do we put as the last digit ?

We will put 4, as a number is divisible by 4 if it's last 2 digits are a multiple of 4
and 54 is not a multiple of 4

-----

Another solution is that we can have a string of (n - 1) 3s and 1 2.

Just avoid putting 2 in the last position

This way the integer will not be even and the sum of digits = 2 (mod 3) so it will
not be a multiple of 3

void solve()
{
    int n;
    cin >> n;

    if(n == 1)
    {
        cout << "-1\n";

        return;
    }

    for(int i = 1; i <= n - 1; i++)
    {
        cout << "5";
    }

    cout << "4\n";
}
