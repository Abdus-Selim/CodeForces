Fact - If there is an interesting subarray, then there is an interesting subarray of length 2.

Proof -

Let us suppose that there are 2 consecutive elements A[i], A[i + 1] such that
|A[i] - A[i + 1]| >= 2

This satisfies our condition and there is at least one interesting subarray.

------

Now, let us suppose that there is no such subarray of length 2 in the array.

This means that for every pair (i, i + 1), the difference is atmost 1.

|A[i] - A[i + 1]| >= 1

For any given subarray of length k, the difference in between the smallest and largest element < k

So, there can be no interesting subarray in the array.

void solve()
{
    int no_of_elements;
    cin >> no_of_elements;

    vector <int> A(no_of_elements + 1);
    for(int i = 1; i <= no_of_elements; i++)
    {
        cin >> A[i];
    }

    for(int i = 1; i < no_of_elements; i++)
    {
        if(abs(A[i + 1] - A[i]) >= 2)
        {
            cout << "YES\n";
            cout << i << " " << i + 1 << "\n";

            return;
        }
    }

    cout << "NO\n";
}
